# Provider Analysis
In this analysis we using three diffrent provider that is XL Axiata, Telkomsel, Tri. We analyze impact from how far the mobile celuler from provider BTS (Base Transciever Station) and we using two range in this test and we using >100 meter (Over hundred meter) and <100 meter (Under hundred meter). This is the network category :
- Exellent  : > -80 dBm and -10 dB
- Good      : -81 to -90 dBm and -11 to -15 dB
- Mid Cell  : -91 to -100 dBm and -16 to -20 dB
- Cell Edge : < -100 and < -20

## A. Over 100 Meter
## XL Axiata

LTE XL Axiata on over 100 meter from the BTS like from this image is :
- RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power)    : -96
- RSRQ (Reference Signal Received Quality)  : -17
- Bandwidth                                 : 3
- ASU (Arbitary Strength Unit)              : 45

The measurement results from the application have the following results:
